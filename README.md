# Expo Go Setup Documentation

## Objective
Mobile development requires more computational resources than web development. To simplify development and testing, this project uses the **Expo Framework for React Native**, which allows running applications directly on a physical mobile device using **Expo Go**.

This document outlines the steps taken to install and configure Expo Go and highlights any challenges encountered during the setup process.

## Development Environment
- **Operating System:** Windows / macOS / Linux  
- **Node.js:** LTS version installed  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code  
- **Mobile Device:** Android / iOS  
- **Framework:** Expo (React Native)

---

## Why Expo Go?
Expo Go provides an efficient way to test React Native applications without installing heavy emulators. It allows:
- Running apps directly on physical devices
- Faster development feedback
- Cross-platform testing (Android & iOS)
- Reduced hardware and setup cost

### 4. Account Setup
- Created a new Expo account (or logged in with an existing account)
- Successfully signed in within the Expo Go app

---

## Verification
- Expo Go opened successfully
- App displayed the home dashboard
- Device ready to scan QR codes from Expo CLI

---

## Challenges Faced
- Initial network issue when connecting device and development machine  
- Resolved by ensuring both devices were connected to the same Wi-Fi network

---

## Conclusion
Expo Go was successfully installed and configured. The device is now ready for running and testing React Native applications using the Expo framework. This setup enables a smooth and efficient mobile development workflow without relying on emulators.
